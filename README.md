## ex:00 - BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ

### Plan
1. **Create `Zombie` class** in `Zombie.hpp` with private name `std::string attribute`.
2. **Create `announce()`** member function/method in the `Zombie` class
```
	std::cout << name << ": BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ...\n";
```
3. **Create `Zombie* newZombie(std::string name);`** function in `newZombie.cpp` that uses new to allocate a `Zombie` on the `heap`.
4. **Create `void randomChump(std::string name);`** in `randomChump.cpp` to create a `Zombie` on the `stack` and make it announce itself.


### Lessons Learned
- **new Operator:** Dynamically allocates an object on the `heap` (see below), letting it live beyond the function scope until you delete it. I.e. the `new` operator creates an object that stays around even after the function ends, so it can ne used later (it must later be freed with the `delete` operator.)


  - **In practice:**
 In `Zombie* z = new Zombie("Foo");`, `new` creates a Zombie `z` named "Foo" by calling its constructor and returns a pointer to it. This way, the Zombie remains available outside the function until the memory is freed with `delete z;`. In the `newZombie()` function, using `new` ensures that the Zombie `z` persists beyond the function scope, so it can be used later.

- **Memory Concepts and the new Operator:**
  - **Stack:**
    Variables declared inside functions (like local variables) are stored on the `stack`. For example:
    ```cpp
    void example()
	{
        int x = 10;
	// 'x' is allocated on the stack and is automatically freed when function returns
    }
    ```
  - **Heap:**
    The `heap` is a memory area used for dynamic allocation. The `new` operator allocates memory on the `heap` and calls the constructor, so the object persists after the function ends. For example, in `newZombie()`:
    ```cpp
    Zombie* z = new Zombie("Foo");
	// allocates a Zombie on the heap; z remains valid outside function
    ```
    After using it, the object's memory must be freed by using `delete`:
    ```cpp
    delete z; // frees the memory allocated on the heap
    ```
    This ensures that the object doesn't get destroyed when a function ends, unlike stack-allocated variables.
  - **Static Memory:**
    Static or global variables exist for the entire lifetime of the program. They are not tied to a specific function's execution.
- **Destructor:**
    The destructor of a class cleans up when an object is destroyed. For Zombies created with new (on the heap), you must call delete to free the memory, which then automatically calls the destructor.

## ex:01 - Moar brainz!

### Plan
This exercise adds **arrays allocation** to the last one. Taking ex00 as a basis:
1. **Change the constructor** to take no parameters (default constructor) and create a set member function to give the object `Zombie` a `std::string name`.

2. **Implement `Zombie* zombieHorde(int N, std::string name);`** in `zombieHorde.cpp`:

   - Allocate an array of `N Zombies` using `new Zombie[N]`:
  ```
  Zombie*	horde = new Zombie[N];
  ```
   - Loop through the array to initialize each `Zombie`â€™s `name`
   - Return a pointer to the first `Zombie`

3. **In main.cpp**:
    Call `zombieHorde()` to create a horde.
    Use delete[] to free the allocated Zombies.

### Lessons Learned
- **array allocation using new and delete operators:**
  Using `new Zombie[N]` allocates multiple objects on the `heap`. These objects persist until explicitly freed with `delete[]`

## ex:03 - Unnecessary violence

### Plan
1. **Weapon Class**:
   - Create a `Weapon` class in `Weapon.hpp` with a private string attribute type.
   - Implement `getType()` to return a constant reference to type.
   - Implement `setType()` to update type.

2. **HumanA Class**:
   - Create `HumanA` in `HumanA.hpp` with a `name` and a `Weapon`.
   - The constructor takes a `name` and a **`reference to a Weapon`** (HumanA is always armed).
   - Implement `attack()` to print:
  ```
  <name> attacks with their <weapon type>
  ```

1. **HumanB Class**:
   - Create `HumanB` in `HumanB.hpp` with a name and a **`Weapon pointer`**.
   - The constructor takes only a `name`; a `Weapon` can be set later with `setWeapon()`.
   - Implement `attack()` to print the attack message only if a weapon is set; otherwise, handle the unarmed case.

2. **Main Function**:
   - Test the functionality for both `HumanA` and `HumanB`.
   - Change the Weapon's type between attacks to verify that the updated weapon type is used.

### Lessons Learned
- **Pointers vs. References**:
  `HumanA` must always have a weapon, so a reference (passed as an argument and stored as a pointer) works well. `HumanB` may not always have a weapon, so storing a `Weapon pointer` that can be `null` is appropriate.
